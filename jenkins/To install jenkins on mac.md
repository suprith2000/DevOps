Jenkins can be installed using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager. Homebrew formula: [jenkins-lts](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jenkins-lts)

This package is supported by a third party. It may not be as frequently updated as packages directly supported by the Jenkins project.

Sample commands:

- Install the latest LTS version: `brew install jenkins-lts`
- Start the Jenkins service: `brew services start jenkins-lts`
- Restart the Jenkins service: `brew services restart jenkins-lts`
- Update the Jenkins version: `brew upgrade jenkins-lts`

After starting the Jenkins service, browse to http://localhost:8080 and follow the instructions to complete the installation. Also see the external materials for installation guidelines. For example, [this blogpost](https://www.macminivault.com/installing-jenkins-on-macos/) describes the installation process.
