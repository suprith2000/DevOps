`vim` (Vi IMproved) is a **text editor** you can use directly from the **macOS Terminal**. It’s a more powerful and enhanced version of the older `vi` editor, and it's widely used by developers and system administrators.

### 🧠 What is Vim Used For?

Vim is primarily used for:

- Editing plain text files (code, config files, notes, etc.)
- Writing scripts and programs
- Working inside servers and development environments

### 🚀 How to Open Vim in Terminal

You just type:

bash

Copy code

`vim filename`

- If the file exists, it will open it.
- If not, it will create a new file named `filename`.

Example:

bash

Copy code

`vim myscript.sh`
